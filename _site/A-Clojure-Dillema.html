<p>Right now I&#8217;m in a dilemma.  Lately, I&#8217;ve been learning Clojure, and its been fun.  Really fun.  I&#8217;m not very far yet, though.  I can hardly do anything in it right now,  I want to get better.  But heres the problem.  I&#8217;m not sure where I can use it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s web development, sure.  I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with Ruby on Rails right  now, and I don&#8217;t really want to waste Clojure&#8217;s beauty on writing glorified <span class="caps">HTML</span> generators.</p>
<p>Clojure runs on the <span class="caps">JVM</span>.  That means it can run basically anywhere.  I can do anything Java can do.  The thing is,  I don&#8217;t know what Java can do.  I know, I know.  Should have though about that before learning Clojure.  Well I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought about writing my weblog in Clojure, but I&#8217;ve done that way too many times in other languages.  It wouldn&#8217;t last very long either.  I&#8217;m skitzo when it comes blogging software.  Wordpress, Jekyll, Tumblr, Posterous, Textpattern.  I&#8217;ve tried them all.  Twice, and I still bounce around between them.</p>
<p>So right now I&#8217;m stuck.  Rails has cornered the web for me, at leas for right now.  And Cocoa owns the desktop and iPhone.  I&#8217;ve thought about learning Android, just to get my Clojure fix, but its not possible to run Clojure on it right now.  As far as I know.  Until something changes, I guess I&#8217;ll be joneseing for my Clojure.</p>
