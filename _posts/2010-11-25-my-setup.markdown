## What I Do
I'm a [high school student](http://www.montessorihighschool.org/).
But, I try not to let it define me.  I try to think of it as my day
job.  At night, I immerse my self in computers.  I administer servers,
write rails apps, iPhone apps, and little scripts to save my self
effort.

## Whats The Hardware
I use two computers, unfortunately.  Since 2008, I've been using a
bottom of the line aluminum MacBook.  2.0gHZ, upgraded to four gigs of
ram.  I love this machine, but she's starting to show her age.  Her
second battery is in need of replacement and she has a dent in the
bottom from when I fell of my bike.

My second machine is a 2010 white MacBook, its for school.  I feel
nothing about this computer.  I have no control over it.  The settings
are locked down and its a pain to install new software.

## Whats The Software

I write a lot of stuff in TextEdit.
Terminal is my most trusted tool.
I code in [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/).
I markup with HTML and CSS in [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/).
I browse in Safari.
I keep my music in iTunes.
Mail is my email client.
[OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/),
[Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) for notes.
[Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) for FTP.
[Divvy](http://www.mizage.com/divvy/) for quick window resizing.

There's probably more, but those are the most important.

## Dream Setup.

A [Happy Hacking
Keyboard](http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&pid=pdkb400wn).
 White / Grey, blank caps.
An [MX Revolution](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Revolution-Cordless-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000HCT12O)
mouse from Logitech.

I want a fifteen inch MacBook Pro, matte display, SSD.  To get really
fancy, a nice twenty seven inch external display from Apple.
