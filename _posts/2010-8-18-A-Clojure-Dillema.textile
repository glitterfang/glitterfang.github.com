title: A Clojure Dillema

Right now I'm in a dilemma.  Lately, I've been learning Clojure, and its been fun.  Really fun.  I'm not very far yet, though.  I can hardly do anything in it right now,  I want to get better.  But heres the problem.  I'm not sure where I can use it.

There's web development, sure.  I'm pretty comfortable with Ruby on Rails right  now, and I don't really want to waste Clojure's beauty on writing glorified HTML generators.

Clojure runs on the JVM.  That means it can run basically anywhere.  I can do anything Java can do.  The thing is,  I don't know what Java can do.  I know, I know.  Should have though about that before learning Clojure.  Well I didn't.

I've thought about writing my weblog in Clojure, but I've done that way too many times in other languages.  It wouldn't last very long either.  I'm skitzo when it comes blogging software.  Wordpress, Jekyll, Tumblr, Posterous, Textpattern.  I've tried them all.  Twice, and I still bounce around between them.

So right now I'm stuck.  Rails has cornered the web for me, at leas for right now.  And Cocoa owns the desktop and iPhone.  I've thought about learning Android, just to get my Clojure fix, but its not possible to run Clojure on it right now.  As far as I know.  Until something changes, I guess I'll be joneseing for my Clojure.
